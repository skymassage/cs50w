            /* One thing to notice about all of our sites so far is that every time we reload the page, 
               all of our information is lost , e.g., the counter goes back to 0.
               Sometimes this is what we intend, but other timeâ€™s we'll want to be able to store information 
               that we can use when a user returns to the site.
            
               One way we can do this is by using Local Storage, or storing information on the user's web browser 
               that we can access later. This information is stored as a set of key-value pairs, 
               almost like a Python dictionary. In order to use local storage, we'll employ two key functions:
               localStorage.getItem(key): This function searches for an entry in local storage with a given key, and returns the value associated with that key.
               localStorage.setItem(key, value): This function sets and entry in local storage, associating the key with a new vlaue. */            
            if (!localStorage.getItem('counter')) { // Check if there is already a vlaue in local storage.
                                                    // The exclamation mark (!) symbol is the logical "not" operator.
                localStorage.setItem('counter', 0); // If not, set the counter to 0 in local storage
            }
                    
            function count() {
                let counter = localStorage.getItem('counter'); // Retrieve counter value from local storage.
                counter++;
                document.querySelector('h1').innerHTML = counter;
                localStorage.setItem('counter', counter);  // Store counter in local storage.
            }

            document.addEventListener('DOMContentLoaded', function() {
                document.querySelector('h1').innerHTML = localStorage.getItem('counter'); // Set heading to the current value inside local storage.
                document.querySelector('button').onclick = count;
            });
            /* We can actually see the value inside of localStorage. 
               Again, go into Chrome's inspector and click "Application" on the tab, 
               and see "Local Storage option" and get into it. We can see that we have a value for the key "counter". */

            // If you want to restart the count, you should clear the cache or open a new incognito window for this page.
