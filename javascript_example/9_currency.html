            /* Example of creating a promise object:
                   let <promise> = new Promise(function(resolve, reject) {
                       <code_if_success>
                       resolve(<value>); // if the job is finished successfully, with result value.

                       <code_if_failure>
                       reject(<error>); // if an error has occurred, error is the error object.
                   });
               "Promise" itself is a constructor function and note that the beginning of it is capitalized. 
               When the Promise constructor function is established, it must receive a function, called executor function, 
               as argument. The executor function includes two argements: "resolve" and "reject" 
               which return the results representing success and failure respectively. 
               Only one of these "resolve" and "reject" can be returned, and then it means that this Promise event has ended. 
               "resolve" and "reject" are pre-defined by the JavaScript engine, so we don't need to create them. 
               The names of "resolve" and "reject" can be customized, but most developers are accustomed to maintaining this name. 
               So the first argument ("resolve") of the executor function is necessary and means success, 
               the secomd one ("reject") is optional and means failure.
               The "new" operator lets developers create an instance of a user-defined object type 
               or of one of the built-in object types that has a constructor function.

               While a promise object is "pending", the result is "undefined".
               When a promise object is "fulfilled", the result is a value.
               When a promise object is "rejected", the result is an error object.

               Promise has a method called ".then()" which also returns a promise object and receive the arguments: 
               callback functions for the fulfilled and rejected cases of the promise, like this:
                   <promise>
                   .then(function(<retuned_value_from_promise>) {     // necearry
                       <code_if_fullfilled>
                   }, function(<retuned_error_from_promise>) {        // optional
                       <code_if_rejected>
                   });
               The first argement handling the fulfilled case is necessary, and the second one handling the rejected case is optional.
               Besides, Promise has a ".catch()" method to handle the rejected case, so the last example can be written as:
                   <promise>
                   .then(function(value) {      // skip this section if rejected
                       <code_if_fullfilled>
                   })
                   .catch(function(error) {     // skip this section if fulfilled
	                   <code_if_rejected>
                   });
               The former example can use ".then()" to handle both fulfuilled and rejected cases, 
               and the latter one will skip one of "then()" and "catch()". */

            document.addEventListener('DOMContentLoaded', function() {
                document.querySelector('form').onsubmit = function() {
                    /* We'll use AJAX (Asynchronous JavaScript And XML), which allows us to access information 
                       from external pages even after our page has loaded. In order to do this, we'll use the "fetch" function
                       which will allow us to send an HTTP request. "fetch" returns a promise which we can think of as a value 
                       that will come through at some point, but not necessarily right away. We deal with promises 
                       by giving them the ".then()" method describing what should be done when we get a fulfilled response,
                       and the ".catch()" method describing what should be done when we get a rejected response,.
                       Note that the argument of ".then()" and ".catch()" is always a function. */

                    /* Notice this URL containing "apikey=<...>" which means you need the API key <...>.
                       You can find many exchage rate APIs online, but generally you must register their websites to get the API keys.
                       And follow the different sites's URL formats and fill in the corrsponding api keys to use their exchage rate APIs.
                       Here is another URL I found online and we can test this api by visiting this URL.
                       When you visit this page, you'll see the current exchange rate between the U.S. Dollar and many other currencies,
                       written in JSON format which looks like the content of the "currency.json" file in this folder.
                       If someday the following URL doesn't work, you can change it to 'currency.json' 
                       which we previously stored the JSON format content of that URL into this file before,
                       but the exchange rate is the one at the time of storing, not the current one. */

                    .then(response => response.json())  // Put response into json form using ".json()". Note that here is no ';' at the end because this field is for arguments.

                        const currency = document.querySelector('#currency').value.toUpperCase(); // Get currency from user input and convert to upper case.
                        const rate = data.rates[currency]; // Get the exchange rate from data. Note that "currency" is a variable, so "data.rates.currency" will return "undefined".

                        /* In JS, both "undefined" and "null" represent the absence of a meaningful value, but they are used in slightly different contexts.
                           undefined: When a variable is declared but not initialized, or when a function does not return a value, 
                                      the variable or the functions result is undefined. For example:
                                        let x; // The variable "x" is declared but not initialized, so its value is "undefined"
                                      Accessing an object property or array element that does not exist also results in undefined, for example:
                                        let obj = {}; // The value of obj.<property> is "undefined".
                                        function doSomething() {
                                            // If no return statement inside of the function, the function will return "undefined".
                                        }
                           null: It is a deliberate assignment that represents the absence of any object value, for example:
                                    let y = null; // The variable "y" intentionally set to "null" 
                                 It is often used to explicitly indicate that a variable or object property should have no value or no reference to any object.
                                    let obj = { <property>: null }; // The value of obj.<property> is "null".
                           1. undefined and null are Falsy value (they are false using if statement).
                           2. null == undefined  // true
                              null === undefined // false
                           3. When we define a variable to "undefined" then we are trying to convey that the variable does not exist. 
                              When we define a variable to "null" then we are trying to convey that the variable is empty. */
