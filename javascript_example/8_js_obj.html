            // A JS object is very similar to a Python dictionary, as it allows us to store key-value pairs.
            let person = {
                first: 'Harry',
                last: 'Potter'
            };
            // Run the following JS code in the console, and the result will be as shown in the comment on the left:
            person;                       // {first: 'Harry', last: 'Potter'}
            person["first"];              // 'Harry'
            person.first;                 // 'Harry'
            person.last = "Ron";          // 'Ron'
            person;                       // {first: 'Harry', last: 'Ron'}
            // Note that you can only use key to access the valuein the JS object. Using propeties will return the "undefined" value.
            property = "first"; // 'Harry
            person[property];   // undefined
            // You can also use "console.log()" to print them out in the console.

            /* One way in which JS objects are really useful is in transferring data from one site to another, particularly when using APIs.
               An API, or Application Programming Interface, is a structured form communication between two different applications.
               For example, we may want our application to get information from Google Maps, Amazon, or some weather service. 
               We can do this by making calls to a service's API, which will return structured data to us, 
               often in JSON (JavaScript Object Notation) form. For example, a flight in JSON form might look like this: */
            // {
            //     "origin": "New York",
            //     "destination": "London",
            //     "duration": 415
            // }
            /* The values within a JSON do not have to just be strings and numbers as in the example above. 
               We can also store lists, or even other JavaScript Objects: */
            // {
            //     "origin": {
            //         "city": "New York",
            //         "code": "JFK"
            //     },
            //     "destination": {
            //         "city": "London",
            //         "code": "LHR"
            //     },
            //     "duration": 415
            // }
