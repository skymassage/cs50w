Git worktree -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
"git worktree" allows us to have multiple working trees attached to the same repository, creating different directories per tree,
enabling you to have multiple branches checked out simultaneously without having to switch back and forth.

Worktrees are automatically configured by Git when we add them. Each worktree has its own ".git" file
with a link back to the repository, ensuring that all worktrees stay in sync with the repository's state.

git worktree add <directory_for_worktree> <branch>: Add a new worktree for <branch> in <path>, 
                                                    so have to use "cd <path>" instead of "git checkout <branch>" to swith branche.
                                                    In <path>, there is the ".git" file containg
                                                    "gitdir: <main_worktree_path>/.git/worktree/<directory_for_worktree>"
                                                    which links back to the main worktree or repository.
git worktree add -b <branch> <directory_for_worktree>: Create a new branch on a new worktree.

git worktree list: List all worktrees

git worktree move <original_directory> <new_directory>: Move the worktree's directory.

git worktree remove <directory_for_worktree>: Remove a worktree. The main worktree can't be removed.

git worktree prune: Prune worktrees (Removes references to worktrees that are no longer valid).
