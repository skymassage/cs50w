# If you're building a database-driven app, chances are you'll have forms that map closely to Django models. 
# In this case, it would be redundant to define the field types in your form, because youâ€™ve already defined the fields in your model.
# For this reason, Django provides a nested class that lets you create a Form class from a Django model.

    # We are going to create a ModelForm subclass. A model form has to have a model to work from, 
    # and the Meta object configures this. Configuration like this is grouped into the "Meta" class to avoid name clashes; 
    # that way you can have a model field in your form without that interfering with the configuration. 
    # In other words, by using class Meta: you get a nested namespace used just to configure the ModelForm in relation to the model.
