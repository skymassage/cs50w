        <!-- We can mitigate how much code we actually need to write by employing a JavaScript framework, 
             just as we employed Bootstrap as a CSS framework to cut down on the amount of CSS we actually had to write. 
             One of the most popular JavaScript frameworks is a library called "React". 
            
             We've been using imperative programming methods, where we give the computer a set of statements to execute. 
             For example, to update the counter in an HTML page we might have code that looks like this:
                View (HTML): <h1>0</h1>
                Logic (JS): let num = parseInt(document.querySelector("h1").innerHTML);
                            num += 1;
                            document.querySelector("h1").innerHTML = num;
             
             React allows us to use declarative programming, which will allow us to simply write code explaining 
             what we wish to display and not worry about how weâ€™re displaying it. 
             In React, a counter might look a bit more like this:
                View (HTML): <h1>{num}</h1>
                Logic (JS): num += 1;

             The React framework is built around the idea of components, each of which can have an underlying state. 
             A component would be something you can see on a web page like a post or a navigation bar, 
             and a state is a set of variables associated with that component. 
             The beauty of React is that when the state changes, React will automatically change the DOM accordingly.

             There are a number of ways to use React, but here we'll focus on getting started directly in an HTML file. 
             To do this, we'll have to import three JavaScript Packages:
             React: Defines components and their behavior.
             ReactDOM: Takes React components and inserts them into the DOM.
             Babel: When we're writing React code, we're not actually going to be writing JavaScript. 
                    We're going to be writing in an extension to JavaScript known as "JSX".
                    JSX is an extension to JS that looks a lot like JavaScript, but has some additional features. 
                    In particular, it effectively allows us to represent HTML inside ofJS code in a way 
                    that is more readable and convenient to deal with. However, browsers don't understand JSX automatically, 
                    so we use "Babel" to convert that code into plain JS code that browsers can understand. -->

        <!-- Import the three JS libraries above. -->

               Components in React can be represented by JS functions.
               To describe a component, we can create a component called "App_1" which is a JS function. 
               The "App" component returns what we would like to render to the DOM.

                   The argument to "useState" is the initial value of the state, which we'll set to "0".
                   "useState" returns both a variable ("count") representing the state
                   and a function ("setCount") that allows us to update the state. */

                       that render occurred due to the "closure" in the function.
                       "setCount(prev => prev + 1)" always uses the latest value for the increment.
                       Because "closures" are a complicated topic, you can test the following two examples to compare the difference.
                       Ex1 (count increments twice): 
                           setCount(prev => prev + 1);
                           setCount(prev => prev + 1);
                       Ex2 (count increments only once):
                           setCount(count + 1);
                           setCount(count + 1); */
