When a bug is discovered it is important to deliver a fix to end users as quickly as possible.
For an example, the developers are working on a new feature branch.
During that new feature development they identify a pre-existing bug on previous stable version (another branch).
The developers fix the bug on the feature branch and commit it, and they want to apply the bugfix to the previous version,
They can use "git cherry-pick" to apply this same commit to the previous version to fix the bug.
"git cherry-pick" is used to take the change introduced in a commit and try to re-introduce it as a new commit on the working HEAD.

Switch to the branch we want to apply the commit to:
	git cherry-pick <commit_SHA1_value>
<commit_SHA1_value> does the same changes,
but the SHA1 value of the commit this command creates is different from <commit_SHA1_value>.
