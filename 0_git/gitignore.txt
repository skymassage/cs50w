.gitignore -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Create a ".gitignore" file in the repository to ignore the files we don't want to add to the repository.
Add the file names we want to ignore to ".gitignore".
If we want to ignore the specific type of files, we can add the item like "*.<file_extension>".

If add the files to the index and then add them to .gitignore, the added file are still in the index.

Go to "https://github.com/github/gitignore" to find the .gitignore files for different languages,
so we can ignore non-code files produced by the language we use in the repository.

If we want to ignore files locally, we can open ".git/info/exclude" and add the files we want to ignore to it.
Because ".git" won't be pushed, so other people won't ignore the files we want to ignore locally.
