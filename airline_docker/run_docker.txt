We may want to run commands within our Docker container to add database entries or run tests. 
To do this, we can follow steps below:

1. docker-compose up: Launch the services inside of new Docker containers.
	    Here we start the app on port 8000, so we can go to "0.0.0.0:8000/flights/" to see the Flights page. 
	    And this is running, not just on my own computer, but inside of a Docker container. 
	    If there are no flights inside of this page because I haven't added anything to the database yet. 

2. docker ps: Show all of the docker containers that are running.
	    We can't run the Django commands inside the host directory the way I used to because it runs in the terminal on our host.
	    So we need to go into the Docker container and run commands there.
	    Run	"docker ps" and find the "CONTAINER ID" of the container (shown on the terminal) we wish to enter to run our commands.

3. docker exec -it <CONTAINER_ID> bash -l: Move to the directory that has been set within the container.
	    Here this command moves us to the "usr/src/app" directory we set up within our container.

4. Now, we can run our commands inside that container. We can run "ls" to show all files inside the container, 
   "python3 manage.py createsuperuser" to create a superuser, 
   or "python3 manage.py migrate" if we want to migrate all of our migrations. 

5. Exit the container by pressing CTRL-D.
