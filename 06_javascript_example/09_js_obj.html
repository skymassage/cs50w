            // A JS object is very similar to a Python dictionary, as it allows us to store key-value pairs.
            let person = {
                first: 'Harry',
                last: 'Potter'
            };
            // Run the following JS code in the console, and the result will be as shown in the comment on the left:
            person;                       // {first: 'Harry', last: 'Potter'}
            person["first"];              // 'Harry'
            person.first;                 // 'Harry'
            person.last = "Ron";          // 'Ron'
            // Note that when you can use key to access the value in the JS object, the key should be a string. 
            property = "first";
            person[property];   // 'Harry'
            person.property;    // undefined
            // "person" doesn't have the "property" key, so "person.property" is undefined.

            // Keys could also be strings.
            let people = {
                "one": 'H',
                "two": 'P'
            };
            people["one"];  // 'H'
            people.one;     // 'H'
            // So the keys must be strings when using keys to access the values of JSON objects,
            // but it's unnecessary for using properties to access the values of JS object.


            /* One way in which JS objects are really useful is in transferring data from one site to another, particularly when using APIs.
               An API, or Application Programming Interface, is a structured form communication between two different applications.
               For example, we may want our application to get information from Google Maps, Amazon, or some weather service. 
               We can do this by making calls to a service's API, which will return structured data to us, 
               often in JSON (JavaScript Object Notation) form. For example, a flight in JSON form might look like this: */
            // {
            //     "origin": "New York",
            //     "destination": "London",
            //     "duration": 415
            // }
            /* The values within a JSON do not have to just be strings and numbers as in the example above. 
               We can also store lists, or even other JavaScript Objects: */
            // {
            //     "origin": {
            //         "city": "New York",
            //         "code": "JFK"
            //     },
            //     "destination": {
            //         "city": "London",
            //         "code": "LHR"
            //     },
            //     "duration": 415
            // }
