<!-- Since Markdown allows users to write HTML tags, users can attack websites by inserting malicious code. 
For example, users can insert JavaScript code to perform cross-site scripting (XSS) attacks, 
or other malicious code to steal sensitive information.
To prevent this security risk, Django provides a safe filter, which is used to mark a string as safe HTML. 
We can use the safe filter by adding "|safe" after the variable name you're substituting to ensure that the generated HTML is safe. -->
<!-- Cross-site scripting (XSS) is a security exploit which allows an attacker to inject into a website malicious client-side code. 
This code is executed by the victims and lets the attackers bypass access controls and impersonate users. -->
