Note that it is normal to see 404 error at the homepage, if we don't set anything for it.
Note that when you create a new app, you must go to "settings.py" to add your app name to the "INSTALLED_APPS" list.

Note that run "python3 manage.py migrate" in the terminal after colpmeling the "tasks" app's code, 
so Django will be able to store the data for the "tasks" app, otherwise it will be errors.
And we just need to run "python3 manage.py migrate" again after creating the "tasks" app.
(There is no need to execute this command before running the server every time.)
